#+TITLE: gudu todos

* Fixes
** DONE Change usage of cond for different segment types to use a protocol
** DONE Handle being inside a servlet container (i.e. handle non root context)

* Requirements
** TODO New segment types
*** DONE string
*** DONE int
*** TODO regex
*** TODO static choice (i.e. set of strings)
*** TODO catch all/multi segment (e.g. wiki)
*** TODO custom/user defined
*** TODO date segments (example of custom?)
    Consume 3 segments e.g. /2013/03/21 but only return one param (map or Java Date?)

* New Features
** TODO Router that auto maps: /<namespace>/<function>/<args> => (apply namespace/function args)
   Notes: see find-ns, find-var, symbol
** TODO Wrappers/Decorators that convert (and simplify) input to gu & output from du
   - e.g.:
     [:a :b] = :a-b
     [:a :b] = :b
   - Questions:
     1. Implement as middleware?
** TODO Functions to walk routes
** TODO Route debugging
** TODO Route linter
   Rules:
*** No duplicate/overlapping segment URLs
    e.g. { :a ["a"], :a2 ["a"] }
         { :s [segment/string], :i [segment/int] }
    Note: overlapping segments (but not entire URL) is ok.
    e.g. { :z ["x" "y" "z"], :a ["x" "y" "z" "a"], :b ["x" "y" "z" "b"] }
** TODO Client side routes generation
** TODO Generate navigation (as hiccup?) from routes
** TODO Generate breadcrumb based on current URL
** TODO Change routes at runtime
   Note: what does this mean for gu, i.e. can you generate routes for other route configurations?

* Minor Features
** TODO Pass context through from gu/du to anonymous functions, allow it to be overridden
** DONE Allow keywords for defining static route segments (as well as strings)
** DONE Helper functions to map routes to handlers
** DONE Add some way to specify the default handlers (e.g. 404, 500)

* Refactoring
** DONE Move segments to gudu.segment

* Documentation
** DONE Generate docs (marginalia or codox)
** DONE Publish docs (gh-pages)

* Examples
** TODO Blog (using date segments)
** TODO Wiki (using multi segment)
** TODO Database backed (custom segment that 404s if id not in database)
** TODO git browser (using custom segment that can do partial matches)
